E/G#         A/C#      D2 
Who could imagine a melody
E/G#             A/C#          D2 
True enough to tell of Your mercy 
E/G#       A/C#         D2 
Who could imagine a harmony 
E/G#               A/C#          D2 
Sweet enough to tell of Your love     

(Pre-Chorus)
             F#m7                         E/G# 
I see the heavens proclaiming You day after day 
        A                                  D2 
And I know in my heart that there must be a way 

(Chorus)
            A         E/G#   F#m7                           DM7 
To sing a greater song, a greater song to You on the earth 
            A         E/G#   F#m7                           DM7 
To sing a greater song, a greater song to You on the earth 
            A         E/G#   F#m7                           DM7 
To sing a greater song, a greater song to You on the earth 
            A         E/G#   F#m7                           DM7 
To sing a greater song, a greater song to You on the earth 

(Verse 2)
E/G#        A/C#         D2 
Who could imagine a symphony 
E/G#               A/C#           D2 
Grand enough to tell of Your glory
E/G#         A/C#                 D2 
Our highest praise but be a feeble breath 
E/G#                 A/C#          D2 
A whisper of Your thunderous worth
