[Verse]

D                                      G
A Pure Heart that’s what I long for
Em                          A                D - A
A heart that follows heart after thee
D                                      G
A Pure Heart that’s what I long for
Em                         A                 D - D7
A heart that follows heart after thee


[Chorus]

G                                 A
A heart that hides your word
Gbm                     Bm
So that sin may not come in
G                        A
A heart’s that undivided
D                        D7
But one you rule and reign
G                                A
A heart that beats compassion
Gbm                  Bm
And pleases you my Lord
G              A
A sweet aroma of worship
G       A           D
That rises to Your
