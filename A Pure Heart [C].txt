[Verse]

C                                      F
A Pure Heart that’s what I long for
Dm                          G                C - G
A heart that follows heart after thee
C                                      F
A Pure Heart that’s what I long for
Dm                         G                 C - C7
A heart that follows heart after thee


[Chorus]

F                                 G
A heart that hides your word
Em                     Am
So that sin may not come in
F                        G
A heart’s that undivided
C                        C7
But one you rule and reign
F                                G
A heart that beats compassion
Em                  Am
And pleases you my Lord
F              G
A sweet aroma of worship
F       G           C
That rises to Your
