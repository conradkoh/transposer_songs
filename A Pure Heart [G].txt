[Verse]

G                                      C
A Pure Heart that’s what I long for
Am                          D                G - D
A heart that follows heart after thee
G                                      C
A Pure Heart that’s what I long for
Am                         D                 G - G7
A heart that follows heart after thee


[Chorus]

C                                 D
A heart that hides your word
Bm                     Em
So that sin may not come in
C                        D
A heart’s that undivided
G                        G7
But one you rule and reign
C                                D
A heart that beats compassion
Bm                  Em
And pleases you my Lord
C              D
A sweet aroma of worship
C       D           G
That rises to Your Throne
