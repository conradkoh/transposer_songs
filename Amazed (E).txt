Verse 1
        E      A              B            
You dance over me
      E      A              B
While I am unaware
E         A         B
You sing all around 
   F#m                    B
but I never hear the sound

Chorus
         A                    B
Lord I'm amazed by You
             E                 A
Lord I'm amazed by You
            F#m              B
Lord I'm amazed by You
                E                     E
And how You love me

           E      A              B
You paint the morning sky
        E          A       B
With miracles in mind
       E         A              B
My hope will always stand
      F#m                      B
For You hold me in Your hand

(REPEAT CHORUS x2)

     A    B
How deep

How wide
     F#m         B                   E
How great is Your love for me
