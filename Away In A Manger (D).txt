AWAY IN A MANGER 
Traditional c1887

Away in a manger, [D]
no crib for a bed [G D]
The little Lord Jesus [A7]
lay down his sweet head [G D]
The stars in the sky [D]
look down where he lay [G D]
The little Lord Jesus [A7 D]
asleep on the hay [Em A7 D]

The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes; But little Lord Jesus, no crying He
makes; I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky; And stay by my cradle
'til morning is nigh. 

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay, Close by me forever, and love me,
I pray. Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care, And fit us for Heaven
to live with Thee there.
