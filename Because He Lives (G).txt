Verse 1:
G                                  C
God sent His son, they called Him, Jesus;
           G              D       D7
He came to love, heal and forgive;
             G    G7        C
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
         G                 D               G
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!


Chorus:
G               G7           C
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
           G                  D
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
          G D G             C
Because I know He holds the future,
            G
And life is worth the living,
D               G
Just because He lives!


Verse 2:
G                           C
How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
           G           D       D7
And feel the pride and joy he gives;
             G    G7          C
But greater still the calm assurance:
               G              D               G
This child can face uncertain days because He Lives!

Chorus:
G               G7           C
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
           G                  D
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
          G D G             C
Because I know He holds the future,
            G
And life is worth the living,
D               G
Just because He lives!

Verse 3:
G                                C
And then one day, I'll cross the river,
                  G         D       D7
I'll fight life's final war with pain;
             G    G7            C
And then, as death gives way to vict'ry,
             G               D                G
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!

Chorus (2x):
G               G7           C
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
           G                  D
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
          G D G             C
Because I know He holds the future,
            G
And life is worth the living,
D               G
Just because He lives!
