[Intro]
G - D - Em - C (2x)

[Verse]
G                       D
Better than the riches of this world
Em                      C
Better than the sound of my friends voices
G                       D
Better than the biggest dreams of my heart
Em              C
And that's just the start
G                       D
Better than getting what I say I need
Em                      C
Better than living the life that I want to
G                       D
Better than the love anyone could give
Em        C
Your love is

[Pre-Chorus]

G          Am         G
You hold me now in Your arms
C               D
And never let me go

[Chorus]

G                              D
You oh Lord make the sun shine
Em                         C
And the moon light in the night sky
G                                  D
You give me breath and all Your love
Em                 C
I give my heart to You because

G            D                          Em
I can't stop falling in love with You
                C                       G               
I'll never stop falling in love with You
