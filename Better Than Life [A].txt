[Intro]
A - E - F#m - D (2x)

[Verse]
A                       E
Better than the riches of this world
F#m                      D
Better than the sound of my friends voices
A                       E
Better than the biggest dreams of my heart
F#m              D
And that's just the start
A                       E
Better than getting what I say I need
F#m                      D
Better than living the life that I want to
A                       E
Better than the love anyone could give
F#m        D
Your love is

[Pre-Chorus]

A          Bm         A
You hold me now in Your arms
D               E
And never let me go

[Chorus]

A                              E
You oh Lord make the sun shine
F#m                         D
And the moon light in the night sky
A                                  E
You give me breath and all Your love
F#m                 D
I give my heart to You because

A            E                          F#m
I can't stop falling in love with You
                D                       A               
I'll never stop falling in love with You
