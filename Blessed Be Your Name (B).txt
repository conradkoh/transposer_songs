B        F#                    G#m            E
 Blessed be You name  in the land that is plenitful
           B          F#               E
Where Your streams of abundance flow  Blessed be Your name
B            F#                       G#m           E
 And blessed be Your name  when I'm found in the desert place
         B                 F#           E
Though I walk through the wilderness  Blessed be Your name


B                     F#               G#m             E
 Every blessing You pour out I'll  turn back to praise 
B                     F#               G#m             E
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord  Still I will say


[Chorus]             
               B           F# 
Blessed be the name of the Lord
                G#m       E
Blessed be Your name
               B           F#
Blessed be Your name of the Lord
                G#m       E
Blessed be Your glorious name


[Verse 2]

B        F#                      G#m            E  
 Blessed be Your name  when the sun's shining down on me
         B               F#              E 
When the world's "all as it should be"  Blessed be Your name
B            F#                    G#m               E
 And blessed be Your name  on the road marked with suffering 
               B           F#         E
Though there's pain in the offering  Blessed be Your name


[Bridge]

    B              F#
You give and take away
    G#m             E
You give and take away
    B                   F#
My heart will choose to say
      G#m               E
Lord, blessed be Your name
