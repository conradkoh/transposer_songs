A        E                    F#m            D
 Blessed be You name  in the land that is plenitful
           A          E               D
Where Your streams of abundance flow  Blessed be Your name
A            E                       F#m           D
 And blessed be Your name  when I'm found in the desert place
         A                 E           D
Though I walk through the wilderness  Blessed be Your name


A                     E               F#m             D
 Every blessing You pour out I'll  turn back to praise 
A                     E               F#m             D
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord  Still I will say


[Chorus]             
               A           E 
Blessed be the name of the Lord
                F#m       D
Blessed be Your name
               A           E
Blessed be Your name of the Lord
                F#m       D
Blessed be Your glorious name


[Verse 2]

A        E                      F#m            D  
 Blessed be Your name  when the sun's shining down on me
         A               E              D 
When the world's "all as it should be"  Blessed be Your name
A            E                    F#m               D
 And blessed be Your name  on the road marked with suffering 
               A           E         D
Though there's pain in the offering  Blessed be Your name


[Bridge]

    A              E
You give and take away
    F#m             D
You give and take away
    A                   E
My heart will choose to say
      F#m               D
Lord, blessed be Your name
