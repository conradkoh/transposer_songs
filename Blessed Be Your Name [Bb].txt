Bb        F                    Gm            Eb
 Blessed be You name  in the land that is plenitful
           Bb          F               Eb
Where Your streams of abundance flow  Blessed be Your name
Bb            F                       Gm           Eb
 And blessed be Your name  when I'm found in the desert place
         Bb                 F           Eb
Though I walk through the wilderness  Blessed be Your name


Bb                     F               Gm             Eb
 Every blessing You pour out I'll  turn back to praise 
Bb                     F               Gm             Eb
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord  Still I will say


[Chorus]             
               Bb           F 
Blessed be the name of the Lord
                Gm       Eb
Blessed be Your name
               Bb           F
Blessed be Your name of the Lord
                Gm       Eb
Blessed be Your glorious name


[Verse 2]

Bb        F                      Gm            Eb  
 Blessed be Your name  when the sun's shining down on me
         Bb               F              Eb 
When the world's "all as it should be"  Blessed be Your name
Bb            F                    Gm               Eb
 And blessed be Your name  on the road marked with suffering 
               Bb           F         Eb
Though there's pain in the offering  Blessed be Your name


[Bridge]

    Bb              F
You give and take away
    Gm             Eb
You give and take away
    Bb                   F
My heart will choose to say
      Gm               Eb
Lord, blessed be Your name
