G                       C
Worthy of every song we could ever sing
G/B                      C
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
G                         C
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
                 G/B           C
We live for you

[Verse 2]
G            C
Jesus a name above every other name
G              C
Jesus the only one that could ever save
G               C
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
            Em
We live for you
            C
We live for you

[Chorus]
C                    Am
Holy there is no one like you
              G
There is none beside you
           Em
Open up my eyes in wonder
C
Show me who you are
    Am
And fill me with your heart
    G
And lead me in your love
     Em
to those around me

[Bridge]
C               D               Em
I will build my life, upon your love
        G
It is a firm foundation
C             D              Em
I will put my trust, in you alone
           G
And I will not be shaken
