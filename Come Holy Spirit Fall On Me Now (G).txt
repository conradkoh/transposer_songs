[Verse 1]

G                             C
Come Holy Spirit fall on me now
G/B                                C
I need Your anointing come in Your power
Am                 D            Bm             Em
I love You Holy Spirit, You’re captivating my soul
    Am                             D
And everyday I grow to love You more


[Verse 2]

             G
I’m reaching for Your heart
             Em
You hold my life in Your hands
           Am
Drawing me closer to You
             D
I feel Your power renew
           Bm            B/D#
Nothing compares to this place
            Em      D       A/C#
Where I can see You face to face
 Am                D             G
I worship You in Spirit and in truth
