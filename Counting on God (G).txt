Desperation Band - Counting On God  

Key: B   With CAPO 4

[Verse]
          G         C       Em  D 
I'm in a fight not physical 
             G        C             Em  D 
And I'm in a war, but not with this world
             G            C        Em  D
You are the light that's beautiful 
            C            D
And I want more, I want all that's Your's 

[Chorus]
G                     C
Joy unspeakable that won't go away 
     Em                      D
And just enough strength to live for today 
      G                         C
So I never have to worry what tomorrow will bring 
          Em                      D
'Cause my faith is on solid rock, I am counting on God 

G                 C
 I am counting on, I am counting on God 
Em                D
 I am counting on, I am counting on God 
G                 C
 I am counting on, I am counting on God 
Em                D
 I am counting on, I am counting on God      

[Bridge]
Em                 C
And the miracle of Christ in me 
G                   D 
Is the mystery that sets me free 
Em                 C
I'm nothing like I used to be 
G                 D
Just open up your eyes, you'll see
