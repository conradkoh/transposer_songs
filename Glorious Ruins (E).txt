Verse 1
         E
When the mountains fall
                    B         C#m     A
And the tempest roars You are with me
        E
When creation folds
                      B         C#m
Still my soul will soar on Your mercy

Pre-Chorus
     A
I'll walk through the fire
        E
With my head lifted high
       C#m                    B
And my spirit revived in Your story
         A
And I'll look to the cross
      C#m
As my failure is lost
       E                      B
In the light of Your glorious grace

Chorus
                      E
Let the ruins come to life
                      A
In the beauty of Your Name
                   E
Rising up from the ashes
                B
God forever You reign
                      C#m
And my soul will find refuge
                      A
In the shadow of Your wings
                   E
I will love You forever
                 B
And forever I'll sing

Verse 2
         E
When the world caves in
                        B        C#m     A
Still my hope will cling to Your promise
         E
Where my courage ends
                          B        C#m
Let my heart find strength in Your presence
