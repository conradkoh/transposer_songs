[Verse]

        G                          D 
God I look to You, I won't be overwhelmed 
           C      Em                 D  
Give me vision to see things like You do 
        G                            D 
God I look to You, You're where my help comes from 
           C         Em               D  
Give me wisdom; You know just what to do 
 

[Chorus]

         C       Am7       D 
I will love You Lord my strength  
         C       Am7       D 
I will love You Lord my shield 
         C       Am7      D     G  
I will love You Lord my rock forever  
         C           D       G     
All my days I will love You God
