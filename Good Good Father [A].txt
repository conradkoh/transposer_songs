A                Asus     A5       A          Asus     A5
I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
A                Asus     A5          A          Asus     A5
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
      D       A/C#                          Bm7        E
You tell me that Your pleased and that I'm never alone


[Chorus]

                      D
You're a good, good father
                 A                     Bm7            E
It's who You are, it's who You are, it's who You are
                    D
And I'm loved by you
                A               Bm7            E
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
A                Asus     A5       A          Asus     A5
But I know we're all searching for answers only you provide
         D             A/C#                Bm7
Because You know just what we need before we say a word

You are perfect in all of your ways 
Bm7                            A
You are perfect in all of your ways 
D                              F#m       E
You are perfect in all of your ways to us

Love so undeniable I can hardly speak

As You call me deeper still
           Bm7     A/C#
As You call me deeper still

As You call me deeper still
      Bm7      E
Into love love love
