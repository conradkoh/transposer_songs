AND WHEN I THINK
THAT GOD, HIS SON NOT SPARING
SENT HIM TO DIE
I SCARCE CAN TAKE IT IN
THAT ON THE CROSS
MY BURDEN GLADLY BEARING
HE BLED AND DIED
TO TAKE AWAY MY SIN!

WHEN CHRIST SHALL COME
WITH SHOUTS OF ACCLAMATION
AND TAKE ME HOME
WHAT JOY SHALL FILL MY HEART!
THEN I SHALL BOW 
IN HUMBLE ADORATION
AND THERE PROCLAIM
MY GOD, HOW GREAT THOU ART!   

主阿 我神！, 我每逢举目观看
祢手所造, 一切奇妙大工
看见星宿, 又听到隆隆雷声
祢的大工, 遍满了宇宙中

当我想到, 神竟愿差他儿子
降世舍命, 我几乎不领会
主在十架, 甘愿背我的重担
流血舍身, 为要赦免我罪

当主再来, 欢呼声响澈天空
何等喜乐, 主接我回天家
我要跪下, 谦恭的崇拜敬奉 
并要颂扬, 神阿 祢真伟大

我灵歌唱, 赞美救主我神
祢真伟大, 何等伟大
我灵歌唱, 赞美救主我神
祢真伟大, 何等伟大
