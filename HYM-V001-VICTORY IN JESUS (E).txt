   I HEARD AN OLD, OLD STORY
   HOW A SAVIOR CAME FROM GLORY
   HOW HE GAVE HIS LIFE ON CALVARY
   TO SAVE A WRETCH LIKE ME
   I HEARD ABOUT HIS GROANING
OF HIS PRECIOUS BLOOD’S ATONING
THEN I REPENTED OF MY SINS
AND WON THE VICTORY

O VICTORY IN JESUS, MY SAVIOR, FOREVER
HE SOUGHT ME AND BOUGHT ME
WITH HIS REDEEMING BLOOD
HE LOVED ME ERE I KNEW HIM
AND ALL MY LOVE IS DUE HIM
HE PLUNGED ME TO VICTORY
BENEATH THE CLEANSING FLOOD

I HEARD ABOUT HIS HEALING
OF HIS CLEANSING POWER REVEALING
HOW HE MADE THE LAME TO WALK AGAIN
AND CAUSED THE BLIND TO SEE
AND THEN I CRIED “DEAR JESUS
COME AND HEAL MY BROKEN SPIRIT”
AND SOMEHOW JESUS CAME AND BRO’T
TO ME THE VICTORY

I HEARD ABOUT A MANSION
HE HAS BUILT FOR ME IN GLORY
AND I HEARD ABOUT THE STREETS OF GOLD 
BEYOND THE CRYSTAL SEA
ABOUT THE ANGELS SINGING
AND THE OLD REDEMPTION STORY
AND SOME SWEET DAY I’LL SING UP THERE 
THE SONG OF VICTORY

VICTORY IN JESUS

Chinese Index (HYM-V002)

我曾听过這故事, 荣耀救主來世間
祂在加略山舍生命, 为要拯救罪人
我听說祂受痛苦, 祂的宝血能洗罪
我悔改來到祂面前, 从此就得胜利

副歌
靠主耶穌必得胜, 我救主常扶助
祂召我又救我, 用祂赎罪宝血
祂愛了我又召我, 要全身心献給祂
主領我得胜利, 靠宝血胜惡魔

我曾听过主耶穌, 医治疾病赦免罪
祂使腐腿能夠行走, 使瞎眼能看見
我呼叫說主耶穌, 求你医治我心灵
祂听見我的祷告, 祂賜給我胜利

我曾听过在天上, 有个荣耀的居所
就是主为我所预备, 碧玉城黃金街
有众天使在歌唱, 歌唱救赎的故事
将來有一天我也要, 高唱得胜凯歌
