Verse 1:
  D                    G        D
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord
  D                    A  A7
A wonderful Saviour to me
   D                     G
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
      D         A          D   G-D
Where rivers of pleasure I see.


Chorus:
   A                     G            D
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
     A7                     D   A7-D
That shadows a dry, thirsty land
   D                     G             
He hideth my life in the depths of his love
    D         A              D   A7-D
And covers me there with his hand.
G   D         A7             D   G-D
And covers me there with his hand.


Verse 2:
  D                    G        D
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord
   D                  A  A7
He taketh my burden a-way
   D                   G
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved
   D         A7             D  G-D
He giveth me strength as my day.
