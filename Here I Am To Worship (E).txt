E                  B                 F#m7
Light of the World, You stepped down into darkness
E                  B                  A
Opened my eyes, let me see
E                  B             F#m7
Beauty that made this heart adore you
E              B                      A
Hope of a life spent with you

Chorus
E#                                  B/D#
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
E/G#                       A
Here I am to say that you’re my God
E                           B/D#
You’re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
E/G#            A
Altogether wonderful to me

Bridge
B        E/#    G      A                      B         E/G#
I'll never know how much it cost, to see my sin
A
Upon that cross

E      B            F#m7
King of all days, oh so highly exalted
E           B   A
Glor-ious  in   heav-en  above
E          B           F#m7
Hum-bly you came to earth you created
E         B      A
All for love’s sake become poor
