(2x)

[Verse 1]
               G
Where would I run
                   D/F#
But to the throne of mercy
               G
Where would I kneel
                  D/F#
But at this cross of grace
              G
How great the love
                      D/F#
How strong the hand that holds us
       Em            A
Beautiful, so beautiful

[Chorus]
   G       A      Bm
So here I bow to lift You high
G   A    Dsus2   D
Jesus be glorified
   G      A        Bm
In all things, for all my life
       G      A       D
I am Yours, forever Yours

[Verse 2]
            G                          D/F#
There is a King who bore the scars of healing
            G                        D/F#
There is a Son who came in grace and truth
               G                        D/F#
How great the love that carries us to kindness
      Em                 A
Wonderful, Youâ€™re wonderful

[Bridge]
    G        A        Dsus2  D
God here and now, be lifted high
       G        A    Dsus2   D
Right here and now, be glorified
        G         A
God of Heaven and Earth
        Bm
God who brought me back to life
      G      A      Bm
I am Yours, forever Yours

[Chorus]
      G      A      Bm
So here I bow to lift You high
G   A    Dsus2   D
Jesus be glorified
   G       A      Bm
In all things, for all my life
      G      A      D
I am Yours, forever Yours
