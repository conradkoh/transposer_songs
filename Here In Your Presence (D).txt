INTRO: D | Em7 | G | D || x2


VERSE:
D                  
Found in Your hands, fullness of joy
Em7                        G                 D
Every fear suddenly wiped away here in Your presence
D          
All of my gains now fade away
Em7                        G                    D
Every crown no longer on display, here in Your presence


PRE-CHORUS:
Bm7         Asus                   G
Heaven is trembling in awe of Your wonders
Bm7                 Asus                    G
The kings and their kingdoms are standing amazed


CHORUS:
              D                Asus
Here in Your presence, we are undone
              Bm7       Asus                 G
Here in Your presence, Heaven and Earth become one
              D                      Asus
Here in Your presence, all things are new
              Bm7      Asus                 G                
Here in Your presence, everything bows before You
