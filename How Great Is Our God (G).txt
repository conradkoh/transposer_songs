Verse 1:
 G                Em7
The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
                    C2
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
 G                  Em7
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
                     C2
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.

Chorus:
G                   D/F#
How great is our God, sing with me,
Em7                  D/F#
How great is our God, all will see,
C            D             G   
How great, how great is our God.

Verse 2:
Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

Bridge:
G              D/F#
Name above all names,
Em7            D/F#
Worthy of all praise,
C
My heart will sing
D                G
How great is our God.
