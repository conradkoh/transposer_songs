Verse 1:
 A                F#m7
The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
                    D2
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
 A                  F#m7
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
                     D2
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.

Chorus:
A                   E/G#
How great is our God, sing with me,
F#m7                  E/G#
How great is our God, all will see,
D            E             A   
How great, how great is our God.

Verse 2:
Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

Bridge:
A              E/G#
Name above all names,
F#m7            E/G#
Worthy of all praise,
D
My heart will sing
E                A
How great is our God.
