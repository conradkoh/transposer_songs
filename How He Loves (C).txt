[Verse]

C
He is jealous for me,
Am
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
G                                          F
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.
C
When all of a sudden,
                      Am
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
      G
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
        F
And how great Your affections are for me.


[Pre-Chorus]

    C                   Am
And oh, how He loves us oh
          G
Oh how He loves us,
                F
How He loves us all


[Instrumental]
C   Am   G/C   F


[Verse]

C
He is jealous for me,
Am
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
G                                          F
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.
C
When all of a sudden,
                      Am
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
      G
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
        F
And how great Your affections are for me.

Oh, how He loves, yeah


[Chorus]

   C
He loves us,
          Am
Oh how He loves us,
          G
Oh how He loves us,
          F
Oh how He loves.


[Verse]

C
We are His portion and He is our prize,
Am
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,
G                               F
If grace is an ocean, we’re all sinking.
C
So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
Am
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
G
I don’t have time to maintain these regrets,
F
When I think about, the way…


[Chorus]

         C
Yeah, He loves us,
          Am
Oh how He loves us,
          G
Oh how He loves us,
           F
Oh how He loves.
         C
Yeah, He loves us,
          Am
Oh how He loves us,
          G
Oh how He loves us,
          F           C
Oh how He loves us oh.
