   I DON’T KNOW ABOUT TOMORROW

   I DON’T BORROW FROM ITS SUNSHINE

   MANY THINGS ABOUT TOMORROW
   I DON’T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND
   BUT I KNOW WHO HOLDS TOMORROW
   AND I KNOW WHO HOLDS MY HAND

EV’RY STEP IS GETTING BRIGHTER
AS THE GOLDEN STAIRS I CLIMB
EV’RY BURDEN’S GETTING LIGHTER
EV’RY CLOUD IS SILVER LINED
THER THE SUN IS ALWAYS SHINING
THERE NO TEAR WILL DIM MY EYE
AT THE ENDING OF THE RAINBOW
WHERE THE MOUNTAINS TOUCH THE SKY

I DON’T KNOW ABOUT TOMORROW
IT MAY BRING ME POVERTY
BUT THE ONE WHO FEEDS THE SPARROW
IS THE ONE WHO STANDS BY ME
AND THE PATH THAT BE MY PORTION
MAY BE THROUGH THE FLAME OR FLOOD
BUT HIS PRESENCE GOES BEFORE ME
AND I’M COVERED WITH HIS BLOOD
I KNOW WHO HOLDS TOMORROW

TS: 3/4                           KEY: A

我不知明日将如何
只一日活过一日
我不借明日的阳光
因阳光或变灰暗
我不为我将来忧愁
因耶稣应许照顾
我只要靠主身旁行
因他知我的前程

我虽然无法能明白
明天所有的事情
但我知谁掌管明天
也深知谁牵我手

我不知明日将如何
或贫穷或是富贵
但那位喂养麻雀的
就是站在我旁的
我的道路无论怎样
或经过水或火焰
但主的宝血遮盖我
他在我前引领我
