In Christ alone will I glory
D/E   Am11   Em7
Though I could pride myself in battles won
D/F#    G
For I've been blessed beyond measure
Em11      Am11        Dsus        D
And by His strength alone I'll overcome
C       D/F#    G2
Oh, I could stop and count successes 
C2/E    Dsus     C2
Like diamonds in my hands
G/D     Em7
But those trophies could not equal 
Am7    G/B    C    C/D     D7
To the grace by which I stand

G/B     C2     G/B
In Christ alone I place my trust
Am9    Am7   C/D   D7   G2    Em7
And find my glory in the power of the cross
Em7/D    Cmaj7    G2     Em7
In every victory, let it be said of me

My source of strength, my source of hope

Is Christ alone

C/D    G2    G
In Christ alone do I glory
D/E   Am11   Em7
For only by His grace I am redeemed

For only His tender mercy
Em11      Am11        Dsus        D
Could reach beyond my weakness to my need
C       D/F#    G2
And now I seek no greater honor in just to know Him more
C2/E    Dsus     C2
And to count my gains but losses to the glory of my Lord
G/D     Em7
Am7    G/B    C    C/D     D7
