Lamb of God

by Chris Bowater   


E       A    E    F#m
Lamb of God, Holy One,
Bm               E7
Je - sus Christ, Son of God,
A          G            D   D#dim
lifted up, willingly to die;
           A              Bm
that I the guilty one may know
               A
The blood once shed
             D
still freely flowing,
      B                A    E
still cleansing, still healing.

CHORUS:
D  E    A    E        F#m
I exalt You, Jesus my sacrifice,
        Bm                      A
I exalt You, my Redeemer and my Lord.
D  E    A    E      F#m
I exalt You, worthy Lamb of God,
       Bm           E                       D  A
And in honour I bow down before Your throne.
