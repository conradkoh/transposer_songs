 Praise You in the heavens, joining with the angels,

 Praising You forever and a day.

 Praise You on the earth now, joining with creation,

 Calling all the nations to Your praise.

 If they could see how much You're worth,

 Your power, your might, your endless love,

 Then surely they would never cease to praise.
