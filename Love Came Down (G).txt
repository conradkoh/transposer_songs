[Verse 1]

          Cmaj7                               Em                D
If my heart is overwhelmed and I cannot hear Your voice 
       Cmaj7                          G             D/F# 
I'll hold on to what is true though I cannot see 
          Cmaj7                               Em                D
If the storms of live they come and the road ahead gets steep 
       Cmaj7                          G             D/F# 
I will lift these hands in faith I will believe


[Pre chorus]

    Am7                   G/E                   D
I remind myself of all that You've done 
             Am7             G/E               C
And the life I have because Your Son


[Chorus]

G
Love came down and rescued me
Cmaj7
Love came down and set me free 
Em           D             C

Em          D          C
I am Yours I am forever Yours

          Cmaj7                               Em                D
When my heart is filled with hope and every promise comes my way
      Cmaj7                           G             D/F# 
When I feel Your hands of grace rest upon me
          Cmaj7                               Em                D
Staying desperate for You God, Staying humbled at Your feet
      Cmaj7                           G             D/F# 
I will lift these hands and praise I will believe

I am Yours, I am Yours, all my days, I am Yours
