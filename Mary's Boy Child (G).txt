Oh my lord, you sent your son to save us Oh my lord, your very self you gave us
D                                         G
Oh my lord, that sin will not enslave us, And love may reign once more.

Oh my lord, when in the crib they found him

Oh my lord, a golden halo crowned him
D
Oh my lord, they gathered all around him
G
To see him and adore... ( His light is shining on us all!)

Oh my lord, ( So praise the lord!) they had begun to doubt you.

Oh my lord, ( He is the truth forever ) what did they know about you? 
D                                                                 G
Oh my lord, ( So praise the lord ) but they were lost without you They needed you so bad.
              D             G
(His light is shining on us all )
