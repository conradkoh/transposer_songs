AMAZING GRACE HOW SWEET THE SOUND
         F                                     Bb/C
THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME
  F                   F/A            Bb          F
I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M FOUND
        F                  C        F
WAS BLIND BUT NOW I SEE

Chorus:
                             Bb                               F/A
MY CHAINS ARE GONE, I'VE BEEN SET FREE
                        Dm                                     C
MY GOD, MY SAVIOR HAS RANSOMED ME
                     Bb                            F/A
AND LIKE A FLOOD HIS MERCY REIGNS
                     Gm   C                 F       
UN-ENDING LOVE, AMAZING GRACE
