   D                                  A/C#
	WHEN THE MUSIC FADES
		                     Em7
	ALL IS STRIPPED AWAY
		               G/A
	AND I SIMPLY COME
   D                                   A/C#
	LONGING JUST TO BRING
			                     Em7
	SOMETHING THAT'S OF WORTH
				             G/A		
	THAT WILL BLESS YOUR HEART
  
Bridge:
   Em                           D/F#                 A      	
	I'LL BRING YOU MORE THAN A SONG
                                                       
	FOR A SONG IN ITSELF 
   Em                       D/F#	            A	
	IS NOT WHAT YOU HAVE REQUIRED
   Em   				 D/F#          A
	YOU SEARCH MUCH DEEPER WITHIN
                                                 	
	THROUGH THE WAY THINGS APPEAR
   Em                               D/F#        A
	YOU'RE LOOKING INTO MY HEART

Chorus:
   D  						   A/C# 
	I'M COMING BACK TO THE HEART OF WORSHIP
		      Em7
	AND IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU
	G                A           D	
	ALL ABOUT YOU, JESUS
				                    A/C#
	I'M SORRY, LORD, FOR THE THING I'VE MADE IT
			Em7
	WHEN IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU
	G                A           D        G/D   D
	ALL ABOUT YOU, JESUS

Verse:
   D                      A
	KING OF ENDLESS WORTH
	                Em7
	NO ONE COULD EXPRESS
   G			A
	HOW MUCH YOU DESERVE
   D                        A
	THOUGH I'M WEAK AND POOR
			 Em7
	ALL I HAVE IS YOURS
	                A	
	EVERY SINGLE BREATH
