       C           G               Am
Who am I? That the Lord of all the earth,
      G               F           G               F     
Would care to know my name, would care to feel my hurt,
       C           G                  Am
Who am I? That the Bright and Morning Star,
      G                   F           G              F 
Would choose to light the way, For my ever wandering heart,
    Am               G       F                      G
Not because of who I am, but because of what You've done,
    Am                   G         F                  G
Not because of what I've done, but because of who You are,


Chorus

C      G              Am           G              F 
I am a flower quickly fading, here today and gone tomorrow,
  G                  F                             C
A wave tossed in the ocean (ocean), a vapor in the wind,
          G                Am                 G                 F 
Still You hear me when I'm calling, Lord, You catch me when I'm falling,
           G             F 
And You've told me who I am.. 
     C
I am Yours.

Verse 2
       C           G                Am
Who am I? That the eyes that see my sin,
      G               F         G             F   
Would look on me with love, and watch me rise again,
       C           G                     Am
Who am I? That the voice that calmed the sea,
      G                    F         G                 F    
Would call out through the rain, and calm the storm in me,
    Am               G       F                      G
Not because of who I am, but because of what You've done,
    Am                   G         F                  G
Not because of what I've done, but because of who You are,
