[Intro] E

[Verse 1]

E                                    
In the quiet
A
In the stillness 
     F#m             B
I know that You are God 
E              
In the secret, 
A
Of Your presence
     F#m             B
I know there I am restored
F#m   A    E      A      B     
When You call I won't refuse 
F#m   A   E     A          B
Each new day again I'll choose


[Chorus]

C#m7             A    E   B    
There is no one else for me
  F#m
None but Jesus
C#m7          A   E   B                                    
Crucified to set me free
        F#m
now I live to bring Him praise


[Verse 2]

E                                
In the chaos
A
In confusion 
     F#m                  B
I know You're sovereign still
E
In the moment 
A
Of my weakness
       F#m             B
You give me grace to do Your will
   F#m   A   E       A      B
So when You call I won't delay
F#m  A   E            A      B
This my song through all my days
  

[Chorus]

C#m7             A    E   B    
There is no one else for me
  F#m
None but Jesus
C#m7          A   E   B                                    
Crucified to set me free
        F#m
now I live to bring Him praise

C#m7 A  E  B 


[Bridge]

C#m7      A        E      B
All my delight is in You Lord
           F#m
All of my hope

All of my strength
C#m7      A        E      B
All my delight is in You Lord
          F#m
Forever more
