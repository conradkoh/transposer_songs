[Intro] D

[Verse 1]

D                                    
In the quiet
G
In the stillness 
     Em             A
I know that You are God 
D              
In the secret, 
G
Of Your presence
     Em             A
I know there I am restored
Em   D    D/F#      G      A     
When You call I won't refuse 
Em   D    D/F#      G      A    
Each new day again I'll choose


[Chorus]

Bm7             G    D   A    
There is no one else for me
  Em
None but Jesus
Bm7          G   D   A                                    
Crucified to set me free
        Em
now I live to bring Him praise


[Verse 2]

D                                
In the chaos
G
In confusion 
     Em                  A
I know You're sovereign still
D
In the moment 
G
Of my weakness
       Em             A
You give me grace to do Your will
Em   D    D/F#      G      A   
So when You call I won't delay
Em   D    D/F#      G      A   
This my song through all my days
  

[Chorus]

Bm7             G    D   A    
There is no one else for me
  Em
None but Jesus
Bm7          G   D   A                                    
Crucified to set me free
        Em
now I live to bring Him praise

Bm7 G  D  A 


[Bridge]

Bm7      G        D      A
All my delight is in You Lord
           Em
All of my hope

All of my strength
Bm7      G        D      A
All my delight is in You Lord
          Em
Forever more
