[Chorus]

E                             B                  C#m
Through You I can do anything, I can do all things
                              A  
Cause its you who gives me strength, nothing is impossible
E                            B                         C#m
Through you blind eyes are open, Strongholds are broken
                 A
I am living by faith, nothing is impossible
