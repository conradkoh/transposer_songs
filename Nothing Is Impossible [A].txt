[Chorus]

A                             E                  F#m
Through You I can do anything, I can do all things
                              D  
Cause its you who gives me strength, nothing is impossible
A                            E                         F#m
Through you blind eyes are open, Strongholds are broken
                 D
I am living by faith, nothing is impossible
