[Chorus]

G                             D                  Em
Through You I can do anything, I can do all things
                              C  
Cause its you who gives me strength, nothing is impossible
G                            D                         Em
Through you blind eyes are open, Strongholds are broken
                 C
I am living by faith, nothing is impossible
