O CHRISTMAS TREE

O Christmas tree, O  Christmas tree,
     Em              A7     D
With faithful leaves unchanging.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
     Em   B7  Em     A7     D
With faithful leaves unchanging,
         G        A7
Not only green in summer's heat,
                  D
But also winter's snow and sleet;

O Christmas tree, O  Christmas tree,
     Em              A7     D
With faithful leaves unchanging.


O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Of all the trees most lovely.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Of all the trees most lovely;
Each year you bring to me delight
Gleaming in the Christmas night.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Of all the trees most lovely.


O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Your leaves will teach me also,
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Your leaves will teach me also
That hope and love and faithfulness
Are precious things I can possess.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Your leaves will teach me also.


O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
How lovely are your branches.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
How lovely are your branches.
In summer sun or winter snow
A coat of green you always show.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
How lovely are your branches.
