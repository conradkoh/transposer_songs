[Verse 1]

A              F#m
Jesus all glorious
Bm                  E
Create in us a temple
A                   F#m
Called as living stones
           Em       E
Where You're enthroned
A                        F#m
As You rose from death in power
      Bm               E     
So rise within our worship
F#m              C#m
Rise upon our praise
             D                  A
And let the hand that saw You raised
D                A F#m
Clothe us in Your glory
Bm                E7
Draw us by Your grace


[Chorus]

E7      D  A           E    D
O the glory of Your presence
E        Bm           F#m     E
We Your temple give You reverence
         A 
So arise from Your rest
        D                B7
And be blessed by our praise
       A      E       F#m   Bm
As we glory in Your embrace
           A      Bm              A
As Your presence now fills this place
