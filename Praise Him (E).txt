Looking out my window
E                 Esus           E
I see the trees blowing in the breeze

Looking out my window

I see the birds flying in the sky

And I know

With just one breath

You created the whole world

And I know

If I don't praise You

The rocks will soon cry out, cry out, cry out..

Praise Him

Lift your voices

Let it ring

Throughout all the earth
E
Praise Him

Let all men know that Jesus Christ

He is alive!
