[Verse 1]

              C        Em            D
The head that once was crowned with thorns
                C     G
Is crowned with glory now
           C        Em       D
The Savior knelt to wash our feet
           C       G
Now at His feet we bow


[Verse 2]

            C        Em       D
The One who wore our sin and shame
             C     G
Now robed in majesty
        C       Em       D
The radiance of perfect love
               C      G
Now shines for all to see


[Chorus]

     C          G       D
Your name, Your name is victory
     C          G       D
All praise will rise to Christ our King
     C          G       D
Your name, Your name is victory
    C           G       D
All praise will rise to Christ our King

[Verse 3]

              C       Em        D
The fear that held us now gives way
           C      G
To Him who is our peace
          C       Em      D
His final breath upon the cross
        C       G
Is now alive in me

[Bridge]

C       G             D             Em           C
By Your Spirit I will rise from the ashes of defeat
      G         D        Em               C
The resurrected King is resurrecting me
        G           D        Em                C
In Your name I come alive to declare Your victory
      G         D       Em    
The resurrected King is resurrecting me

[Verse 4]

               C        Em         D
The tomb where soldiers watched in vain
             C         G
Was borrowed for three days
          C          Em     D
His body there would not remain
            C           G
Our God has robbed the grave
            C           G
Our God has robbed the grave
