[Verse 1]

              G        Bm            A
The head that once was crowned with thorns
                G     D
Is crowned with glory now
           G        Bm       A
The Savior knelt to wash our feet
           G       D
Now at His feet we bow


[Verse 2]

            G        Bm       A
The One who wore our sin and shame
             G     D
Now robed in majesty
        G       Bm       A
The radiance of perfect love
               G      D
Now shines for all to see

              G       Bm        A
The fear that held us now gives way
           G      D
To Him who is our peace
          G       Bm      A
His final breath upon the cross
        G       D
Is now alive in me

[Verse 4]

               G        Bm         A
The tomb where soldiers watched in vain
             G         D
Was borrowed for three days
          G          Bm     A
His body there would not remain
            G           D
Our God has robbed the grave
            G           D
Our God has robbed the grave
