HIDE ME NOW, UNDER YOUR WINGS
COVER ME, WITHIN YOUR MIGHTY HAND

WHEN THE OCEANS RISE
AND THUNDERS ROAR
I WILL SOAR WITH YOU
ABOVE THE STORM
FATHER YOU ARE KING
OVER THE FLOOD
I WILL BE STILL AND KNOW
YOU ARE GOD

FIND REST MY SOUL, IN CHRIST ALONE
KNOW HIS POWER, IN QUIETNESS AND TRUST

隐藏我, 在祢翅膀下
护庇我, 用祢大能膀臂

当那雷声响海洋升起
在暴风中, 主与祢上腾
在泛滥中, 主坐着为王
我将静默知祢是神

在基督里, 寻见安息
安息中, 得知主的权能
