A                                               Bm       D
He's coming on the clouds   kings and kingdoms will bow down
F#m                                          E        D
Every chain will break  as broken hearts declare His praise

Who can stop the Lord Almighty

For the sins of the world     His blood breaks the chains
                     E                           D

Every knee will bow before Him

The God who comes to save   is here to set the captives free
                      E
For who can stop the Lord Almighty

For the sins of the world     His blood breaks the chains
                     E                           D
And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
