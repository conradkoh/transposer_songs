[Verse]

E         A          C#m      B
  You are here as we lift you up
       E              B
You are riding on our praise
E        A          C#m       B
  Be enthroned over everything
        E               B
You are seated in our praise


[Pre-Chorus]

C#m                        B
  This is prophetic I can feel it in the air
A                          B
We lift our praise and you change the atmosphere
C#m                         B
  With hearts open now everybody singing out
A     B
Oh!

I am free!


[Chorus]

        E                 B
Turn it up this sound of praise
            A
Make it louder than any other
          E                 B        C#m - A - B
Lift him up and shout his name over all


[Verse]

E         A          C#m      B
As we praise I can feel the change
       E              B
As your presence now invades
E        A          C#m       B
Hear the sound of the broken chains
       E              B
Prison doors are giving way
