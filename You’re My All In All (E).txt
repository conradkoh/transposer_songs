E          B                  C#m
You are my strength when I am weak
            E             B A
You are the treasure that I seek
           E   B  E  B7
You are my all in all
E           B             C#m
Seeking You as a precious jewel
             E         B A
Lord to give up I’d be a fool
           E   B  E
You are my all in all

E          B                  C#m
Taking my sin my cross my shame
            E             B A
Raising again I’ll bless Your name
           E   B  E  B7
You are my all in all
E           B             C#m
When I fall down, You pick me up
             E         B A
When I am dry, You fill my cup
           E   B  E
You are my all in all
