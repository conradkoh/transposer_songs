Bb   F   Eb

Verse 1:
           Bb
In Christ alone will I glory
       F               Gm              Eb
Though I could pride myself in battles won
              Bb
For I’ve been blessed beyond measure
    F                Gm            F
And by His strength alone I’ll overcome
Cm                            Gm
Oh, I could stop and count successes
              F     Eb
like diamonds in my hands
          Cm                 Gm
But those trophies could not equal
       Eb                F
to the grace by which I stand


Chorus:
           Eb               Bb/D
In Christ alone I place my trust
            Cm           F            Bb
And find my glory in the power of the cross
         Eb    F/Eb          Dm      Gm
In every victory let it be said of me
   Cm                     G#        F
My source of strength, My source of hope
           Bb
Is Christ alone


Verse 2:
In Christ alone do I glory
For only by His grace I am redeemed
For only His tender mercy
Could reach beyond my weakness to my need
And now I seek no greater honor
In just to know Him more
And to count my gains but losses
To the glory of my Lord


Chorus (Final):
G               F               C/E
     In Christ alone I place my trust
            Dm           G            C             
And find my glory in the power of the cross
         F    G/F          Em     Am
In every victory let it be said of me
   Dm                     Bb         G
My source of strength, My source of hope
           C
Is Christ alone
耶稣基督

我愿全心荣耀耶稣 
放弃倚靠我自己的骄傲
你的祝福无法测度 
靠你能力我能胜过世界

而我不再看我所有成就 如同手中珍宝
一切奖赏都不能够 与你的恩典相比

耶稣基督 我的倚靠
你的十字架是我永远的荣耀
生命每个气息 都是属於你
我的源头 我的盼望
是你我主

我愿全心荣耀耶稣 
因你恩典使我得新生命
你的怜悯触摸我心 
你慈爱为我的软弱效力

而我这一生别无所求 只愿更认识你
所有成就都不能够 与我的主荣耀相比
